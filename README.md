# Rock-vs-Mine-Prediction
The ultimate goal of the "Mine vs. Rock Prediction" project is to develop a reliable and accurate model that can assist in real-world scenarios such as underwater mine detection, ensuring the safety and security of maritime operations. Continued refinement and optimization of the model may involve fine-tuning hyperparameters.
